Here are some string literals:

  "Hi, there!"
  "I am a string literal."
  "It is so tedious making up good examples!"
  "'"

These are not legal string literals:

  """
  "Abercrombie\"and\"Fitch"
  "Continued on the next ...\
... line"

Were you surprised at how any of that scanned?

Why or why not?
